			  <p>Hello! 
				My name is Shannon (actually not Alice- more on that later) and I am the artist behind Hello Alice! I live in northern Connecticut with my family and our adorable greyhound named Lucy. I'm a self proclaimed "doodler" and art lover who started Hello Alice in 2019 as a way to finally DO something with my little drawings. I'm also a queer (intersectional!) feminist who loves pattern and color, tchotchkes, being in the woods, books, tea, and hording art supplies in between investigating every local coffee shop I can find. 
				I believe in kindness and empathy and care passionately about social justice. I enjoy making things that are cute and quirky but also have something to say. You can find all of these themes (and more) in my work.
				
				Oh, and p.s.- The “Alice” in Hello Alice is my grandma! She was a pretty cool (and crafty) lady. 
				
				Thanks for being here!
